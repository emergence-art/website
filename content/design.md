The egg frame is made up of laser cut plywood and the shell is a decorative fabric that encompasses the structure.

Large seating areas are on each side of the shell allowing people to relax and observe others to interact and experience the art.

The design style depicts a fusion of art and advanced technology.  Inspired from the art movement of Modern Art (Art Nouveau - Art Deco) on the exterior, while transitioning to a Steampunk Futurism aesthetic inside the Egg Shell.

The art representation will be incorporated within the structure itself accompanied by the lighting and music.
