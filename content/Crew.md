Vitaly Winter, Lead Artist
---
I first came to Burning Man to build a home.  What profoundly touched me, was the art and the sheer amount of creativity that fostered a meaningful experience.  It has inspired me to use my engineering talents to create a powerful experience for others and, in kind, bring meaning to their lives.  My inspiration for Emergence stems from my ongoing philosophical pursuit about our nature and existence. My wish is for this art to bring more questions than answers.

Nick Reimnitz, Lead Mechanical Designer
Burning Man culture has reignited my childhood wonder in creating for the sake of joy and connection. Since that first life changing event, I have strived to use my mechanical engineering background to stoke the fire of my art and creativity. Emergence was a perfect fit for me, and when invited to the project it was a no-brainer!

Lidia Darkova, Fundraising and Storytelling
I am an artist, designer, marketer and a burner. Through Burning Man, I discovered a deep satisfaction that comes from using art to help people communicate thoughts, ideas, and emotions that can't be expressed with words alone. As a community we constantly evolve in our artistic endeavors, technology and knowledge and now we face a new journey into the unknown of Artificial Intelligence. I'm so incredibly honored to be a part of the Emergence project that is not only artistic, but thought provoking as well.

Eric Mintzer, Software Infrastructure Design
I am thrilled to be part of a team merging advanced technologies from mechanical, software, and design in to a single comprehensive vision that will hatch on the playa. My maker background is geeking out over pushing the technical limits across disciplines and my creative background is curious to discover how Emergence will evolve before and on the playa.

David Marchaland, Embedded Controls
After my first burn in 2016, I knew that becoming involved with an art project will be part of a next journey to Home.  This year, I had the opportunity to board in the Emergence journey, a subtle balance between art and technology.  Living in SF and working as an electrical engineer, I cannot be more excited to bring a technical experience to the creation of an hardware and software platform to give life to an inert structure.  Let’s motor and LEDs!

Liza Lichtinger, MA, LMHC, LPCC, Robotic and Behavioral Interaction Advisor
The intent of this project is to harness the fire which fuels emergent technology gracefully, to  direct profound behavioral shifts within all whom come across the gifts hatched from this egg.
