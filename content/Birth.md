<p>The story begins with the construction of the egg and comes to a climactic unveiling when it hatches.  The journey of the sentient machine is not unlike our own path to consciousness.  It begins with just matter slowly taking on its complex order.  Gradually, the mind forms and sensory data begins shaping its first neural connections leading up to its awakening, the birth.  Upon gaining consciousness, it experiences the natural emotional process of self-awareness: fear, joy, and wonder.  Wonder not only about the world around it, but about you! How will you perceive the machine?  How will it perceive you?</p>
