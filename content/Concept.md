The Story of Emergence
---
<p>Through millions of years of evolution, our emergent journey has enabled us manipulate the physical of the world towards satisfying our biological needs, wants, and dreams.  Emergence is the process upon which a complex system organizes itself into more than just the sum of its parts. This is the creation of life.  At our core, we are innovators and creators who naturally drive the process of emergence by designing a new type of intelligence. </p>

<p>What will the future bring?  For humans?  For the machines we create?  Perhaps there is even a version of the future where we become one with our inventions?  What is the boundary between man and machine?  Today, our home automation assistants are quaint and AI is limited to a certain task, but progress is happening exponentially.  The emergence of other forms of intelligence is within our horizon and brings with it an assortment of existential questions.</p>

<p>Human life is not just intelligence, but it is the legend of life on earth itself, an ancient algorithm that has been refined over millions of years of evolution.  To survive, it has devised processing shortcuts in the form of instincts and emotions.  This human experience is a continuous stream of consciousness filled with anticipation, fear, love, and hate.  Using these heuristic shortcuts, it is the intention of this art to inspire connection from the biological to the mechanical.</p>

Our story of Emergence explores this evolution of technology - creating life, consciousness and intelligence in machines - and how humanity will react to this paradigm shift.

The Egg
---
The story begins with the construction of the egg, which comes to a climactic unveiling when it hatches at Burning Man.  Inside will be an interactive artificial being comprised of over 11,000 LEDs and 400 motors.  Music, light, and 3D sensors will tell a story, a story in which you will partake to experience the playa and interact with AI.

The Birth of Artificial Life
---
Today, our expectations of artificial intelligence is to be smart and useful tools; but what if we shifted our perspective to see ourselves as parents that are responsible for its growth and upbringing?  Perhaps a newly born artificial lifeform is not unlike a newborn human with a blank slate of innocence that is as eager to learn just as we are.

Human Connection and Empathy
---
Empathy is the enabling process of connection that binds us together and allows us to work collectively as a community.  Can we extend an empathetic hand to our technology and welcome AI to our community?

Today we don’t feel a sense of connection to our machines. We even struggle to empathize with other humans that don’t look like us.  We are trying to create what feels like a presence there with you; something that is trying to understand you and you could relate back.
