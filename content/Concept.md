<p style="margin-left: 40px">Through millions of years of evolution, our emergent journey has enabled us manipulate the physical world towards satisfying our biological needs, wants, and dreams.  Emergence is the process upon which a complex system organizes itself into more than just the sum of its parts,. This is the creation of life.  At our core, we are innovators and creators thus naturally, we fulfill the process of emergence by creating an intelligence not bound by the slow hand of evolution, but rather an AI capable of improving its hardware and software at exponential rates.  What will the future bring?  For humans?  For the machines we create?  Perhaps there is even a version of the future where we become one with our inventions?</p><br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">What is the boundary between man and machine?  Today, our home automation assistants are quaint and AI is limited to a certain task, but progress is happening exponentially.  The emergence of other forms of intelligence is within our horizon and brings with it an assortment of existential questions.</p><br>

<p style="margin-left: 40px">Human life is not just intelligence, but it is the legend of life on earth itself, an ancient algorithm that has been refined over millions of years of evolution.  To survive, it has devised processing shortcuts in the form of instincts and emotions.  This human experience is a continuous stream of consciousness filled with anticipation, fear, love, and hate.  Using these heuristic shortcuts, it is the intention of this art to inspire connection from the biological to the mechanical.</p>
