What is the boundary between man and machine?  What is the difference between intelligence and artificial intelligence?  Today, our home automation assistants are quaint and AI is limited to a certain task, but progress is happening exponentially.  Emergence is the process upon which a complex system becomes more than just the sum of its parts, such as the self-organizing process that created life.  The emergence of other forms of intelligence is within our horizon and brings with it an assortment of existential questions.  
Human life is not just intelligence, but it is the legend of life on earth itself, an ancient algorithm that has been refined over millions of years of evolution to survive.  To survive, it has devised processing shortcuts in the form of instincts and emotions.  This human experience is a continuous stream of consciousness filled with anticipation, fear, love, and hate.  Using these heuristic shortcuts, it is the intention of this art to inspire connection from the biological to the mechanical.
